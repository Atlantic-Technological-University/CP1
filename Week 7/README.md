- Handling exceptions
- Functions  

## Directory content  

The directory contains two sub directories:

- __Demos__: contains demo code illustrating basic concepts covered in the slidedeck for this week.  

- __Practical__: Practical exercises to help reinforce the code concepts covered in the lecture and slidedeck for this week.  

If you notice any issues or errors create an issue or better, still offer a solution and create a pull-request.
